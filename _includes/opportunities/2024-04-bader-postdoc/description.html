<p>I am currently accepting applications for an <b>associate post-doctoral position</b>, starting as soon as possible, 
    to work on an innovative NIH-funded project at the <b>University of Vermont</b>  investigating 
    the impact of<b>screen time</b> on the developing brain.</p>

<p>Stipends will start from approximately <b>$56,500</b> per year, depending on previous post-doctoral experience.</p>

<p>The selected candidate will be based in the University of Vermont - Department of Psychiatry,
    and will be primarily performing cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a large-scale,
     multi-modal dataset including different types of screen time (such as videogaming, 
     TV/YouTube watching, and social media use), behavioral and mental health measures, neurocognitive testing,
      and MRI scans (structural and functional), tracking ~11,000 children and adolescents from the nation-wide 
      <b>ABCD study</b> (https://abcdstudy.org/). Additionally, the candidate will have the opportunity to explore and analyze other large and longitudinal neuroimaging datasets (IMAGEN, ENIGMA-addiction), as well as interacting and collaborating with local and national leaders in the fields of neuroimaging, psychopathology, and neurocognitive development.</p>

<p>Candidates must have completed doctoral training in <b>computer science, neuroscience, bioinformatics, or a related discipline</b>
    , and have a record of research in neuroimaging or big data analysis. Experience in <b>neuroimaging analyses</b> and <b>programming</b> in at least one language (ex. MATLAB, Python, R, bash) are required as prerequisites. 
    Big data analysis skills will be highly valuable but not required. 
    Candidates must also demonstrate basic statistical competence and show interest in one or more types of screen time activity. <br>
 <br>
This post-doctoral position a unique and exciting opportunity to analyze a one-of-a-kind remarkably large and rich dataset in children and adolescents and make critical contributions to our understanding of how screen time impacts brain development, neurocognition and mental health.</p>
